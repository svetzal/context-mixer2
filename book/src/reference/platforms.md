# Platform Paths

cmx can install agents and skills to any supported AI coding assistant platform.
With no `--platform`, `install`/`uninstall` act across every platform already in
use (falling back to Claude Code when nothing is tracked yet), and single-target
commands default to Claude Code. Use the `--platform` flag or the `CMX_PLATFORM`
environment variable to target one specific platform — Claude Code's unsuffixed
lock file (below) preserves backward compatibility with installs made before
platform selection existed.

## Selecting a platform

```bash
# Install to Cursor globally
cmx agent install python-craftsperson --platform cursor

# Install to Windsurf locally
cmx skill install skill-creator --platform windsurf --local

# Set the platform via environment variable
export CMX_PLATFORM=copilot
cmx agent install python-craftsperson
```

The `--platform` flag is global — it applies to all subcommands.

¹ **Codex agents are TOML, not markdown.** cmx agents are markdown files with
YAML frontmatter; the Codex CLI defines subagents as standalone TOML files. When
you install an agent with `--platform codex`, cmx transforms the source markdown
into a Codex subagent document (`<name>.toml`) with `name`, `description`,
`developer_instructions` (the markdown body), and an optional `model` field.

² **Skills-only platforms.** Pi, Crush, Amp, Zed, OpenHands, and Hermes have no
file-droppable agent concept (their "agents" are tool-gating profiles, runtime
delegations, executable plugins, or trigger-activated skills), so
`cmx agent install --platform <tool>` fails with a clear error. They support
skills only.

³ **Amp resolves user-scoped skills under XDG** (`~/.config/agents/skills/`)
rather than `~/.agents/skills/`. Project skills still use `.agents/skills/`.

⁴ **Hermes is global-centric.** Its auto-read source of truth is
`~/.hermes/skills/`, so cmx installs user-scoped skills there. Project skills use
the shared `.agents/skills/`, which Hermes reads only if you add it to
`skills.external_dirs` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.

## The shared `.agents` skills convention

The `.agents/skills/` directory (project) and `~/.agents/skills/` (user) is an
emerging cross-tool standard — the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)
`SKILL.md` format. opencode, Codex, Pi, Crush, Zed, and OpenHands all read it
natively, so cmx installs skills there for the whole cohort. (Amp and Hermes read
the project `.agents/skills/` too but resolve user-scoped skills elsewhere — see
notes ³ and ⁴.) This is a **shared directory**: a skill installed under one of
these platforms is visible to the others.

A practical consequence: because each platform keeps its own lock file (below),
uninstalling a skill with one of these platforms removes the underlying
`.agents/skills/<name>` directory for *all* tools that read it. Reinstall it
under the other platform if you only meant to stop tracking it for one.

## Per-platform lock files

Each platform maintains its own lock file so installations for different tools
do not interfere with each other.

| Platform | Global lock file | Local lock file |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock.json` |
| Copilot | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-copilot.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-copilot.json` |
| Cursor | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-cursor.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-cursor.json` |
| Windsurf | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-windsurf.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-windsurf.json` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-gemini.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-gemini.json` |
| opencode | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-opencode.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-opencode.json` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-codex.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-codex.json` |
| Pi | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-pi.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-pi.json` |
| Crush | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-crush.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-crush.json` |
| Amp | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-amp.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-amp.json` |
| Zed | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-zed.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-zed.json` |
| OpenHands | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-openhands.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-openhands.json` |
| Hermes | `~/.config/context-mixer/cmx-lock-hermes.json` | `.context-mixer/cmx-lock-hermes.json` |

Claude Code keeps `cmx-lock.json` (no suffix) for backward compatibility with
installations made before platform selection was introduced.
